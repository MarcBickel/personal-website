I've been building software for over a decade now. Along the way, I've learned that the most satisfying work isn't about the technology itself.

## What matters

The best projects I've worked on shared a few things:

- They solved real problems for real people
- The team cared about the outcome, not just the process
- We shipped early and learned from feedback

## What doesn't

I've also wasted time on things that felt important but weren't:

- Chasing perfect architecture before understanding the problem
- Adding features nobody asked for
- Optimizing things that didn't need optimizing

## The lesson

Build the simplest thing that could work. Ship it. Learn. Repeat.

Everything else is procrastination in disguise.
